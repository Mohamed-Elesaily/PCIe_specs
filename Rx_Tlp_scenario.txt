1- Received data from PIPE interface with width (number of lanes * pipe width).
2- PIPE Rx Data module checks dataValid is asserted and 
detects start of the block by detect startblock signal
which will know the data is packet or ordered sets by check 2 bit sync header.
3- In descrambler module Tx LTSSM will choose descramble width depending on PIPE width(8, 16, 32, ...), 
and then descramble data and ignore reserved symbols.
4- LMC un-strips data bytes.
5- Packet identifier will take the output of LMC
by checking 2 bit sync header(10 -> data block).
It will remove STP and END and set SOP and EOP.
6- LPIF Rx Ctrl & DF module Forwards data to LPIF in 512 bit width.
